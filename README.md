TheOdinProject Recipe Assignment

This project at first seemed intimidating. I knew that with patience and time, that I could get this done. HTML is a language I thought was outdated but I understand it's importance now. Along with CSS, you can build a stunning, website with the two languages. I don't plan on stopping there though. I have a lot more that I want to learn!

Thankfully to one of my friends, I found TheOdinProject. I was skeptical at first thinking that I couldn't learn for free. Boy was I wrong. The amount I have learned in just this short period of time is nothing short of incredible. I feel as though this is something I should've pursued a long time ago. Since my wife and I have been blessed with our newborn, babygirl. I have wanted to ensure I can provide everything they need. Less than a year ago I started my journey into IT. I have a dream and I know that I can achieve it.
