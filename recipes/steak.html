            <li><strong>Cast iron pan, grill pan, or other heavy bottomed skillet</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Small bowl</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tongs or Spatula</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Digital meat thermometer</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients Needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sirloin Steaks</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canola Oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Minced Garlic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Parsley Flakes</strong></li>

        <h3><strong>Cooking Steps:</strong></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat your pan and then add the oil. Let the oil get hot before adding your steaks. Similar to letting the uncooked steak rest at room 
                temperature before cooking, if you start to pan sear your steak in a cold skillet while the pan slowly heats it will slowly cook your 
                steak and again run the risk of overcooking and never giving you a good sear. </li>
            <li>Just as important as preheating your skillet, do not overcrowd your pan! Your steaks need air around them to achieve a perfect sear. 
                If you overcrowd your pan, your steaks will steam rather than sear. If you need to make more steaks than will fit in your pan, sear 
                them in batches and transfer them to a warm oven and cover them with foil.</li>
            <li>Lastly, use a meat thermometer to check your temps. Keep in mind once removed from the heat your steak will continue to cook. Remove 
                them from the skillet on the lower end of your ideal temp. Most importantly, let your steaks rest for at least five minutes after 
                cooking. This will let them finish cooking and allow the juices to redistribute giving you the perfect juicy pan-seared steak.</li>
        </ol>
