        <h1>Easiest Chinese Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/rice.jpg" alt="Chicken fried rice">
        <p>Time to change that with this easy, one-skillet recipe that's ready in 20 minutes and better than takeout. 
        You'll never be tempted again to eat rice from a flimsy white takeout container after trying homemade. The 
        chicken is moist and juicy and there are green onions, garlic, sesame oil, and soy sauce for layers of flavor.</p>
        <p>My favorites are the bits of scrambled eggs. Fried rice just isn't fried rice without those coveted bits of
        eggs that I go searching for and devour those little treasures first. It's such an easy and healthy weeknight 
        dinner you can whip up in no time and the leftovers are great for lunches!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>To make this chicken fried rice recipe, you'll first add the oils and diced chicken to a large skillet.
                Cook the chicken over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until no longer pink inside. Remove the chicken
                to a plate while you stir-fry the veggies.</li>
            <li>To the same skillet, add the peas, carrots, and green onions. Once softened, add the garlic.</li>
            <li>Push the veggies to one side of the skillet, and scramble the eggs on the other side. Add the chicken back to
                the pan, followed by the rice. Drizzle everything with soy sauce and cook until everything is heated through. </li>
